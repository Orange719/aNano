# aNano
A little bash script that outputs an ascii version of Nano Shinonome (東雲なの).


You can run it by typing this into your terminal:
```
sh ./anano
```

If you want to make this a command that you can run from any directory, make it executable and move it to /usr/bin/ by typing this into your terminal:
```
chmod -x anano
sudo mv ./anano /usr/bin/anano
```
